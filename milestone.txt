CS193X Final Project Milestone
==============================

Project Title: Bunny Dress-Up
Your Name: Noor Fakih
Your SUNetID: nfakih

Overview
--------
So far, things are good! I created basically all the front end and explored sign in with google. I want the user to be able to log in and save the bunnies they create. I am currently switching the code into a format with classes but hopedully that will be fine. I am a bit nervous about using mongo again but no trouble yet.


Project Changes
---------------
I might have the user sign in with google!

Implementation Details
----------------------
Frontend:
The user is fully able to change the bunny's outfit, background and accessory. I will switch the implementation to one that utilizes classes. There will be a Closet class that will hold the background, outfits, and accessory info. The Bunny class will represent the a version of the dressed up bunny. The User class will have the user email as their unique id and an array of Bunny objects to represent their saved outfits.
