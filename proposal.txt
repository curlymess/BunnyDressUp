a dress-up game where the user can:

Milestone(s)
------------
By the milestone I would like to have the skeleton of the website up and all the images done.

n/a - only need js, html and mongodb!

Collaboration and resources

I will probaby draw the outfit items myself! No other resources needed other than documentation and course material.
